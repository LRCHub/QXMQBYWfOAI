I can never be like you
I don't ever talk like that
You smile with a sparkler drink
And stumble in your lipstick mess
Hollywood philosophies
Yeah it's a tragedy
But you keep hanging on
With a vacant look
Just waiting around for someone to take you home
And I know you know I'm not the one
I'm sorry I was late I didn't want to come
Oh no man it's just not that much fun
My eyes are wandering
Can we just eat the news
And dance around the room
In our scattered point of views
Take my hand and breathe
Yeah just count to three
I wish that I could blink
and turn all your words
Into ice cubes so I could fill my drink
And I know you know I'm not the one
I'm sorry I was late next time I just won't come
Oh man I think I've gotta run
Hey what's that called
when you're sitting on your couch
And having fun just being by yourself
Wondering why we can't commit to love
The things that we've got we always want more of
I know you'd rather have me fake it
but I'm not gonna make it
Oh no man now I gotta run
