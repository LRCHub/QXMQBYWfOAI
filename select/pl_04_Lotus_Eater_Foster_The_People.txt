If the world should end today
We've spent too much time
Worrying about yesterday
If the world should end today
We've had our time
And time is now slipping away
Time is now slipping away
Faster than yesterday
If the world should end today
We've had our time
And time is now slipping away
We've had our time
And time is now slipping away
Time is now slipping away
Faster than yesterday
My days are all uncovered
They float back through my mind
Recalling the forms
of the people you loved
Then leaving the past behind
Putting a name to the darkness
That occupies my heart
All this decay washed away
by the rain
Moving back inside
Into my memory
Moving into the light
If the world should end today
There's been too much time
Worrying about yesterday
If the world should end today
Always been too much time
Worrying about yesterday
If the world should end today
Always been too much time
Worrying about yesterday
I've spent too much time
Worrying about yesterday
Always spend too much time
Worrying about yesterday
